Personally, a new academic journey has begun. Funded by the China Scholarship Council, I began a one-year overseas visit to Urban Analytics Lab (UAL), at the Department of Architecture of the National University of Singapore (NUS), a leading global university centred in Asia..

About [UAL](https://ual.sg/about/), this research group was established in 2019 by its Director/PI Dr Filip Biljecki, Assistant Professor at the NUS College of Design and Engineering and the NUS Business School, and has been a home for dozens of enthusiastic researchers who share ambitions about making our cities smarter. You can read more about our research agenda also in an interview with the PI.

Their mission is to leverage and make sense of big geospatial data at different scales for urban applications and catalyse the development of spatial data infrastructures and digital twins in the realm of smart cities and the built environment. We are particularly interested in the interface of emerging urban datasets such as street-level imagery, dynamic/sensor data, and 3D city models with the state of the art of artificial intelligence to solve contemporary urban challenges and provide a strong foundation to advance urban informatics. Crowdsourcing plays an important role in our research, as we follow and contribute to the vibrant and impressive developments in Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and engage such data in our advancements.

In UAL, my research focus on the from street-level imagery to perceive urban slope (terrain, road, building relief and ...)
