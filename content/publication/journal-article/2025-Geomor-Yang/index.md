abstract: Anthropogenic forces have become a significant factor in the development of geomorphology, influencing landform morphology and usage in diverse ways across natural and societal environments. Despite their growing impact, few studies have quantified the morphology and distribution of anthropogenic landforms at large scales to reveal the spatial patterns of human modification on the surface. To address them, we propose a framework that includes three classical anthropogenic landforms, i.e., terraces, check dams, and impervious surfaces, on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to measure the morphology differences at the basin level. Using 10-meter resolution geospatial datasets, we conducted a quantitative analysis of spatial patterns across four landscape dimensions. We developed a scoring system based on the entropy-weight method to measure the intensity of anthropogenic landforms. Additionally, a data-driven clustering algorithm incorporating spatial dependence was applied to regionalize anthropogenic landforms. Our findings reveal significant spatial variations in the distribution of anthropogenic landforms. The east-central and west-central areas of the Loess Plateau exhibit clear signs of human modification, with high-intensity anthropogenic landforms concentrated near densely populated areas. The clustering effect of these landforms is particularly prominent in the central-eastern zones of the CLP due to the population and many soil and water conservation measures. By regionalizing anthropogenic landforms into eight distinct regions, each characterized by unique morphological features. Four regions are dominated by terraces; two regions are settlement-dominated and the others are mixed. Moreover, the study classifies these regions into three types by their topography features and demonstrates that natural topographic conditions strongly influence the spatial patterns of anthropogenic landforms, underscoring the interplay between human modifications and the physical environment. This research provides a new perspective and robust methodological framework for analyzing the morphology pattern of anthropogenic landforms. It could be a data foundation for future studies exploring the interactions between human activities and geomorphological processes.
